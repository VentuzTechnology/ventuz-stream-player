# streamout-webcomponent

INTERNAL DOC SO FAR

Development:
- "npm install" to init project
- use Ventuz Trunk or >=8.2, set up device config with stream output, run something
- "npm run dev" to start the dev server
- "npm run build" to build the component in /dist

Usage:
- NPM based projects: add a local dependency from your project to this one
- Others: Just include dist/ventuz-stream-player-min.js in your project
- For the rest, check out dist/index.html, it's not really hard :)
