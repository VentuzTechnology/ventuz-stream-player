# streamout-webcomponent

INTERNAL DOC SO FAR

- "npm install" to init project
- use Ventuz Trunk or >=8.2, set up device config with stream output, run something
- "npm run dev" to start the dev server
- "npm run build" to build the component in /dist (TODO: proper file name and everything)
